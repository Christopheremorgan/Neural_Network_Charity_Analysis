# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: 
Build a deep learning model that predicts whether applicants are likely to be successful if funded by the charitable organization, Alphabet Soup.

Alphabet Soupâ€™s business team provided a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. Within this dataset are a number of columns that capture metadata about each organization and whether the project was successful.

The Python packages Pandas and SciKit-Learn are used to:
- preprocess the data
- compile, train, and evaluate the neural network model
- optimize the model 

## Results: 
Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address aal 6 of the following questions.

Data Preprocessing
What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?
Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?

## Summary: 
Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and explain your recommendation.
There is a summary of the results (2 pt)
There is a recommendation on using a different model to solve the classification problem, and justification (3 pt)
